# TechGallery
Welcome to Tech Gallery, a centralized developer repository where I showcase a selection of my projects. Let's connect and innovate together!


## Project Categories

- [BERT Text Classification Model Fine-Tuning for Q&A Chat Bot]
	- Fine-Tuned BERT (distilbert-base-uncased) model for text classification. The data consisted of 500 questions and its answers. 5 variations of each question were generated and assigned to a class. The total data having more than 3000 questions was divided into 650+ classes. This data was used to fine-tune and validate the BERT model to classify the question to a perticular class, returning the answer of that class would complete the Chat Bot functionality.

- [Bitcoin Prediction Using LDA Topic Modelling]
	- Bitcoin price prediction using topic modelling on news to cater in the affect of news sentiment.

- [Chat Bot TextEmbeddings-Gecko@001 Model]
	- Flask Application Endpoint to use the chatbot on the front end. It uses a csv file containing the questions, answers and its generated embeddings which can be used for similarity comparison between the user input. It also stores logs for user input in the static directory.
	- Chat Bot using Google's Gecko@001 Model to generate Text Embeddings and using cosine similarity, built a Chat Bot.
	- Evaluation mechanism for the chat bot by automatically generating test questions (variations of the original data) and giving the Chatbot's Response, Ground Truths and the accuracy score.
	
	
- [Google Cloud Platform]
	- AI Doctor Vertex AI Chat-Bison Flask APP
		- A simple chat model integrating GCP's Vertex AI Chat-Bison/Text-Bison LLM API with fixed guide prompt with user input to suggest home remedies for medical symptoms
	- Enterprise Search Application
		- Using Google Cloud's GenApp Builder Enterprise Search, made an application (FLASK) and tested a search engine on custom data.
	- Healthcare Natural Language API Application
		- Using Google Cloud's Healthcare API, developed a FLASK endpoint to generate medical codes (ICD10, RxNorm, UMLs etc.)
	
- [Lang-Chain Vertex-AI Bigquery]
	- Utilizing Lang-Chain (Text to SQL) for Big-query data using Vertex AI's Text-Bison Language Model.

- [Machine Learning Notebooks]
	- Small Diverse ML Projects and algorithms implementation.
 
- [Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib]
	- Data Visulization Notebooks and Guides.

- [Roman Urdu Natural Language Processing]
	- Poetry Generation, Noisy Channel Spell Correction, and Transliteration. All in either Urdu or Roman Urdu.

- [University Projects C & C++]
	- Initial univeristy semester projects and assignments in C & C++.

- [Web Dev PHP]
	- Basic Gym Management System using Oracle SQL Server and PHP

- [Web Scraping]
	- Daraz.pk website's crawler collecting information about any given product
	- MorningStar Financials web crawler to generate daily market reports
	
- [Whisper Speech to Text]
	- Whisper model Speech to Text and conversion of audio files from OPUS to MP3.
